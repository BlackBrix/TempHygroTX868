/*
 * Arduino library to control the ELV TX868 rf transmitter module
 * to send temperature and humidity values over the air at 868.35 MHz.
 * The communication protocol is compatible to ELV sensors like the
 * S 300 and ASH 2200, therefore the data may be received by weather
 * stations like USB-WDE 1, WS 200/300, and IPWE 1 manufactured by ELV 
 * (http://www.elv.de).
 * The library has been extended to implement the old ELV sensor
 * transmission protocol V1.1 as well. This should support 
 * Thermo/Hygro sensors like the AS2000 and ASH2000 which are using the
 * 433 MHz transmitter HFS-300.
